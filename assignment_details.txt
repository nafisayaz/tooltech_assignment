DO NOT USE ANY DATABASE for the below assignment, use JSON.
 

The task is to create a C++ software library that will determine which Water distribution Profile is current at a given time 
and support the other distribution network.

I want to apply a current limit on Water distribution, so everyone gets a fair share of water.

The following data fields and rules must be supported and used during the selection of the current limit:

• Stack level  ( for ex.  4 houses at a time or 10 houses at a time )

• House ID

• Supply profile kind (once, Recurring)

• Recurrency kind (Daily, Weekly) (*only for kind=Recurring)

• Transaction ID

• Validity date and time  (Valid for 01.12.2022 to 30.12.2022) // 

• Schedule start time   

• Schedule duration  ( Monday – 2hrs, Tues- 5hrs and other day 1hrs)

• Relative period start time


The supply status structure that is given as an input has the following data fields:

• Current reference date and time

• House ID

• current Transaction ID (if any)

• current supply start time (if current transaction) Expected output from the library

• Current water distribution profile ID



Expected output from the library

• Current Supply Profile ID

• Current schedule ID

• Reference to the current Supply period object, from which it is possible to read:

▪ Limit value (e.g. 2000)

▪ Limit type (e.g. Gallon)

 

Requirements listing

A. Library shall provide a JSON supply profile parser, that takes in a JSON string as input (in memory), and will output objects describing the supply profile.

This library will be embedded into the main firmware.
